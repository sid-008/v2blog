description: Material from the talk I gave at FOSS united blr!

Recently I had the chance to give a talk at the Razorpay office as a part of FOSS United Bangalore's meetup. This was a full length talk
and I had a great time talking to like minded people about this.

This itself is a pretty niche topic, but a lot of people aren't really aware of the system-d feud, so I decided why not give a talk on it?
The material I used for the talk is below.
