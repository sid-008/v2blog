      <title>A love letter to Motorcycling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my first motorcycle when I was in my 6th semester of college. It was a honda h&amp;rsquo;ness CB350.&#xA;I had only ever commuted to college on my activa until then. It was my dad&amp;rsquo;s decision to buy one,&#xA;for some reason he was motivated to buy a bike. Obviously I use it more than him now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid one of my uncles owned a Yamaha R1 and I have liked bikes ever since then. He also&#xA;owned an Aprilia RSV4 later on and a whole slew of KTM 390s and most recently a KTM 390 adv. The roar&#xA;of the engine of a liter bike was something else to behold. Little did I realise as a kid that these&#xA;motorcycles were quite actually literal death machines that would go incredibly fast at breakneck speeds.&#xA;Those aggressive looks were enough to seduce a younger me into the world of motorcycling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-is-a-community&#34;&gt;So what is a community?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one word? Its home. For me at least, Hackerspace PESU-ECC&amp;rsquo;s Mentor team, GDSC PESU-ECC &amp;lsquo;22 and ACM PESU-ECC had&#xA;been my &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; for quite a while. The relentless memes. The insanely enlightening&#xA;conversations. Learning from almost everyone there. The banter, the inside jokes,&#xA;everything on that little whatsapp group was fun. It felt like&#xA;&amp;ldquo;my people&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;d often call it home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how do you build such a community?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is a visionary?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-visionary&#34;&gt;What is a visionary?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was first asked this question in my CIE L1 course(A wonderful course offered by my university on entrepreneurship) it made me think. My immediate first thought was: Steve Jobs.&#xA;But it didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question of what a visionary person really is. This post is meant to be a reflection on this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve asked various people on their thoughts regarding this, along with the answers I listened to in class, most people tend to use words like&#xA;&amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ideas&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo;. But that didn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense to me. Anyone can be an ideas man, innovation may well be part of being a visionary,&#xA;but a video I watched by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJpU43NA0c&amp;amp;t=542s&#34;&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt; on youtube defined what a visionary is to me at least in the most concise manner possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Iran-Contra Affair</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This was originally published &lt;a href=&#34;https://munsocecc.vercel.app/posts/iran_contra_affair&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, check out PESU-ECC&amp;rsquo;s MUNSOC site and show them some love!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;iran-contra-affair&#34;&gt;Iran Contra Affair&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sale of arms to Iran, hostage exchanges(supposed), hezbollah and the civil war in Nicaragua. How are all these related? Well its a long story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms; during the second Reagan term, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sales of weapons to Iran which at the time was under an arms embargo, and diverted the profits to the Contras, a group of anti-socialist rebels in Nicaragua that were opposed to the socialist Sandinista led government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
